## Installation
N/A

## Credits
A lot of W3 and MDN to get the syntax for jQuery correct, as I didn't have much of it memorized prior to this project.

## License
Please refer to repo.

## Features
This project features the use of jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the planner. I used event listeners, local storage, dynamic classes, and a lot of DOM traversals to accomplish the functional webpage.
